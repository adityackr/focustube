# FocusTube

**FocusTube turns any YouTube playlist into a calm, course-style classroom — no recommendations, no Shorts, no comments, no autoplay rabbit holes. Just the videos you chose, in order.**

Paste a playlist link (or ID) and FocusTube imports every video — titles, thumbnails, order, channel info — then lets you watch it like a proper online course, with a collapsible lesson sidebar, per-video progress tracking, favorites, and recents. Everything lives in your browser: no account, no tracking, no server-side watch history.

## Why this exists

YouTube's watch page is engineered to keep you watching — recommended videos, Shorts, comments, autoplay. That's the opposite of what you want when you're working through a tutorial series, a lecture playlist, or a course someone shared with you.

FocusTube solves exactly one problem: **watch a YouTube playlist start-to-finish without getting sidetracked.** It behaves like the video player on a course platform (Udemy, Coursera): one focused player, one clean lesson list, progress tracking, nothing else.

## Features

### Landing page (`/`)

Marketing-style homepage with a hero (live-feel classroom mock), stats, feature grid, 3-step "how it works", and a call-to-action panel — all in small section components under `components/landing/`.

### Library (`/library`)

- Grid of all saved playlists with channel, lesson count, and hover play overlay.
- **Drag-and-drop reordering** via a grip handle on each card (mouse, touch, and keyboard accessible). The order persists across reloads and is mirrored in the sidebar.
- Add playlists through a dialog that accepts a raw playlist ID, a `youtube.com` URL, or a `youtu.be` URL.
- Favorite (heart) and delete actions per card. Deleting always asks for confirmation through a shadcn-style alert dialog.

### Collapsible app sidebar

Available on Library / Recent / Favorites. Collapses to a slim icon rail, works as a slide-in drawer on mobile, and contains:

- Navigation (Library, Recent, Favorites with a count badge).
- Search across playlist titles and channels.
- The full playlist list in your manual order, each row opening its classroom, with hover-reveal favorite/delete actions (rendered as a floating chip so rows stay compact).
- Skeleton rows while the library is loading.

### Watch pages (`/watch/[playlistId]`, `/watch/[playlistId]/[videoId]`)

- **Playlist overview**: cinematic hero with thumbnail, lesson count, description, and a "Start watching" button.
- **Distraction-free player**: `youtube-nocookie` embed, lesson counter, completion badge, "Next lesson" button, title and description — nothing else.
- **Collapsible lesson sidebar**: progress bar, lesson search, per-lesson watched toggles, active-lesson highlight. Collapses to a single "Show N lessons" button on desktop; a full list below the player on mobile.
- **Watch progress**: opening a video marks it watched; checkmarks toggle manually. Progress survives refreshes (stored per playlist in `localStorage`).
- Opening a shared `/watch/…` link for a playlist you don't have yet **auto-imports** it.
- Loading skeletons for both the hydrating and importing states; a proper not-found card otherwise.

### Cross-cutting

- **Dark / light mode** with system support (`next-themes`), honey-amber brand theme.
- **Toast feedback** (Sonner) for imports, deletes, and errors.
- **Loading skeletons** on Library, Recent, Favorites, sidebar, and watch pages — no flashing empty states.
- **Delete confirmations** everywhere via a shared alert dialog (no native `confirm()`).
- Fully **TypeScript**, fully **responsive**.

---

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed.
- A **YouTube Data API v3 key** — create one at [Google Cloud Console → Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) and enable the _YouTube Data API v3_ for your project.

### 1. Clone

```sh
git clone https://github.com/adityackr/focustube.git
cd focustube
```

### 2. Configure environment

```sh
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Then set your key in `.env.local`:

```sh
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_data_api_v3_key
```

The key is **server-only** (plain `YOUTUBE_API_KEY`, never `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`) — it is used exclusively inside the `/api/playlists` route and never reaches the browser.

### 3. Install & run

```sh
bun install
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### 4. Build & start

```sh
bun run build
bun start
```

### 5. Test

```sh
bun test
```

---

## How it works

```
Paste link/ID
  → lib/utils.ts `parsePlaylistInput()` extracts the playlist ID
  → store `fetchPlaylist()` calls GET /api/playlists?playlistId=…
  → app/api/playlists/route.ts uses YOUTUBE_API_KEY against
      /playlists (metadata) + /playlistItems (all pages) via lib/youtube.ts
  → playlist saved to Zustand store → persisted to localStorage
  → classroom opens at /watch/[playlistId]
```

- **IDs accepted**: raw IDs (`PL…`), `youtube.com/playlist?list=…` / `watch?v=…&list=…`, `youtu.be/…?list=…`.
- **API route** caches responses at the edge (`s-maxage=300`) and returns clean 400/404/502 JSON errors.
- **Watch progress** (`hooks/use-watch-progress.ts`) stores `{ watched[], lastWatched }` per playlist in `localStorage`. Mutations go through a ref mirror so mount-time auto-marking can never clobber previously saved progress (this exact race is covered by a regression test).

## Routes

| Route                           | Type            | Description                                      |
| ------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `/`                             | Static          | Landing page (hero, features, how-it-works, CTA) |
| `/library`                      | Static + client | Saved playlists, drag-to-reorder grid            |
| `/recent`                       | Static + client | Last opened playlists (up to 12)                 |
| `/favorites`                    | Static + client | Pinned playlists                                 |
| `/watch/[playlistId]`           | Dynamic         | Playlist overview + lesson list                  |
| `/watch/[playlistId]/[videoId]` | Dynamic         | Focused player + lesson sidebar                  |
| `/api/playlists?playlistId=…`   | Route handler   | Server-side YouTube fetching                     |

`/library`, `/recent`, `/favorites` share the `(app)` route group layout with the collapsible sidebar. The watch routes have their own minimal header layout.

```

**Conventions**: one component per file, co-located tests (`*.test.ts(x)`), server components by default with `"use client"` only where interactivity/state demands it, and shared selectors (`selectPlaylistList`) consumed via `useShallow` to keep snapshots referentially stable.

---

## State & persistence

No backend, no accounts. Two browser-persisted slices:

| Key                                   | Owner                                  | Contents                                           |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `focustube-library`               | Zustand `persist` (`store/library.ts`) | `playlists`, manual `order`, `favorites`, `recent` |
| `focustube:progress:<playlistId>` | `use-watch-progress`                   | `watched[]`, `lastWatched` per playlist            |

Upgrading from Clean YouTube? Data stored under the old `clean-youtube-*` keys is adopted automatically on first load (and the old keys removed). Clearing site storage resets the app to a fresh state.

---

## Scripts

| Command         | Purpose                                 |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `bun dev`       | Development server (Turbopack)          |
| `bun run build` | Production build                        |
| `bun start`     | Serve the production build              |
| `bun test`      | Unit/component tests (bun test + jsdom) |
| `bun run lint`  | Next.js lint                            |

---

## Design system

- **Brand**: FocusTube — honey-amber primary (`oklch(0.68 0.13 64)`) with deep warm-charcoal foreground, dusty-rose-free gradients, working in both light and dark themes. All brand color flows from `--primary` / `--ring` in `app/globals.css`.
- **Logo**: custom inline-SVG `LogoMark` (amber-gradient squircle + rounded charcoal play triangle), also served as the favicon via `app/icon.svg`. Two-tone wordmark: _Focus_ in foreground, _Tube_ in primary.
- **Primitives**: shadcn New York style, `zinc` base, CSS variables, `rounded-xl` radius. Icon-only buttons use `ghost` + `size="icon"`; destructive actions use the shared `DeletePlaylistButton` alert dialog.

---

## Testing

`bun test` runs the suite (jsdom preloaded via `bunfig.toml`):

- `store/library.test.ts` — ordering (prepend, dedupe, manual `setOrder`, storage round-trip, legacy fallback) and removal cleanup.
- `hooks/use-watch-progress.test.tsx` — mount-merge without wiping stored progress, the full _watch → next → refresh_ scenario, and toggle on/off persistence.

---

## Deployment

The app deploys as a standard Next.js app (e.g. Vercel):

1. Import the repository.
2. Set the `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` environment variable.
3. Build command `bun run build` (or `next build`), output served with `bun start`.

No database or additional services required.
